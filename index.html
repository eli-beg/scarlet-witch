              <h3>Childhood and origin</h3>
              <p>
                Wanda Maximoff was born in 1989[7] in Sokovia, Eastern Europe,
                unaware that she was born a witch and unknowingly engaging in
                basic hex magic. While growing up with her twin brother Pietro
                and her parents Oleg and Iryna in a small apartment during a
                war, she enjoyed watching American sitcoms, which her father
                sold DVD box sets of so their family could practice speaking
                English in the hopes of emigrating to America. However, Oleg and
                Iryna were killed when a missile struck their apartment while
                Wanda and Pietro were trapped in the debris for two days. While
                a second Stark Industries missile flew in, it never went off as
                Wanda unknowingly cast a probability hex that turned it into a
                dud, though the twins lived in fear of it going off until they
                were rescued. The trauma of that experience found a focus in the
                prominence of the Stark Industries logo printed on the missile.
                This left the twins with the fervent belief that Stark himself
                was ultimately responsible for their parents' deaths as it
                occurred via sales of his company's weapons which he had
                intentionally profited from.
              </p>
              <p>
                Years later, as young adults, Wanda and Pietro participated in
                political protests in their city, before eventually volunteering
                for Hydra's enhancement program overseen by Baron Wolfgang von
                Strucker. The organization exposed the twins and numerous other
                test subjects to the Mind Stone, with Wanda and Pietro being the
                only survivors and the former gaining psychic abilities while
                her magic was greatly amplified. During the experiments, Wanda
                gained a glimpse of herself as the Scarlet Witch.

            <div class="overview-sub-section">
              <h3>Becoming an Avenger</h3>
              <p>
                In 2015, Wanda is called by Strucker to assist in fighting Steve
                Rogers upon his arrival to Strucker's base. She then finds Tony
                Stark and plants a nightmarish vision in his mind. Shortly
                after, Ultron secures an alliance with Wanda and Pietro, using
                their hatred of Stark as leverage. In Johannesburg, Wanda
                subdues Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Thor, and Bruce Banner with
                visions, however, is unable to subdue Clint Barton, as he
                briefly incapacitates her. Following this, Ultron, Wanda, and
                Pietro travel to Seoul, where Ultron uses the Mind Stone to
                enslave Dr. Helen Cho so he can use her synthetic-tissue
                technology, vibranium, and the Mind Stone to craft a new body.
                As Ultron uploads himself into it, Wanda reads his mind and
                discovers his plan to cause human extinction. She and Pietro
                turn against Ultron and join forces with Rogers to stop him.
                Upon learning of Stark's plan to give the body life and fearing
                what he will do with it, Rogers takes Wanda and Pietro to
                Avengers Tower to stop him. While Rogers and Stark fight, Wanda
                fights Banner, but Thor suddenly arrives and turns the body into
                the "Vision". Wanda and Pietro tell them of Ultron's plot and
                they decide to travel to Sokovia, where Ultron has used his
                remaining vibranium to build a machine capable of lifting a
                large section of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it
                into the Earth and cause global extinction. Wanda becomes
                overwhelmed by her role in Ultron's scheme until Barton
                befriends and encourages her to join them in stopping Ultron.
                Wanda volunteers to protect the machine's core from Ultron, but
                abandons her post to destroy Ultron's primary body after sensing
                Pietro's death, which allows one of his drones to activate the
                machine. Vision rescues Wanda from the collapsing city.
                Afterwards, Wanda goes to the Avengers Compound, where she,
                along with Sam Wilson, James Rhodes, and Vision, join the
                Avengers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometime later, Wanda is watching sitcoms in her bedroom, when
                she is visited by Vision, who comforts her over Pietro's death,
                assuring her that the grief she feels over losing her family
                meant that she still loved them.

              <h3>Avengers Civil War</h3>
              <p>
                In 2016, Wanda joins Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson in stopping
                Brock Rumlow from stealing a biological weapon from a lab in
                Lagos. Rumlow detonates his suicide vest in an attempt to kill
                Rogers, but Wanda telekinetically contains the explosion and
                throws it upward, accidentally killing several Wakandan
                humanitarian workers, to her horror. As a result, United States
                Secretary of State, Thaddeus Ross, informs the Avengers that the
                United Nations (UN) is preparing to pass the Sokovia Accords,
                which will establish a UN panel to oversee and control the team.
                Stark has Wanda confined to the Compound, where Vision watches
                over her and they begin to develop romantic feelings for each
                other. After Rogers and Wilson go rogue to aid Bucky Barnes,
                they send Barton to pick up Wanda and Scott Lang before
                regrouping at Leipzig/Halle Airport, Germany. Wanda
                significantly helps her team through the battle, protecting them
                from Stark's team. After Rogers and Barnes escape, Wanda,
                Barton, Wilson, and Lang are captured and detained at the Raft.
                Eventually, they are rescued when Rogers breaks them out.

              <h3>Infinity War and resurrection</h3>
              <p>
                In 2018, Wanda and Vision have begun a romantic relationship and
                gone into hiding in Edinburgh. However, they are ambushed by
                Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive, members of the Children of
                Thanos sent to retrieve the Mind Stone. Rogers, Wilson, and
                Romanoff rescue them and take them back to the Compound, where
                they reunite with Rhodes and Banner. While there, Vision asks
                Wanda to destroy the Stone, but she refuses as it would kill
                him. Rogers suggests they travel to Wakanda, which he believes
                has the resources to remove the Stone without killing Vision. As
                Shuri works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision, Wanda is
                tasked with staying behind and watching over the operation until
                the Stone is removed. Nevertheless, she leaves to aid the
                Avengers in their fight against the Outriders, killing Midnight
                in the process. When Thanos arrives to retrieve the Mind Stone
                himself, Wanda reluctantly kills Vision and destroys the Stone,
                but Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse the action and rip the
                repaired Mind Stone from Vision’s forehead, before knocking out
                a horrified Wanda and activating the completed Infinity
                Gauntlet. Wanda, along with half of all life in the universe,
                disintegrates in an event that would later be called the Blip.
              </p>
              <p>
                Five years later, Wanda is restored to life and joins the
                Avengers and their allies' battle against an alternate Thanos,
                who came from an alternate universe, and his army, during which
                Stark sacrifices himself to win. A week later, Wanda attends
                Stark's funeral and reunites with Barton.

              <h3>Life in Westview</h3>
              <div class="overview-sub-section">
                <h4>The Hex and the WandaVision program</h4>
                <p>
                  The next day, Wanda goes to S.W.O.R.D.'s headquarters to
                  retrieve Vision's body. After meeting with S.W.O.R.D.'s acting
                  director Tyler Hayward however, she is shown Vision being
                  dismantled and realizes she can no longer sense him. She
                  leaves and drives to the suburban town of Westview, New Jersey
                  to view a vacant lot that Vision had purchased in 2018 for the
                  two "to grow old in". Overcome with grief, Wanda accidentally
                  unleashes waves of chaos magic that transforms Westview into a
                  sitcom-themed false reality and isolates it from the outside
                  world via a hexagonal barrier, later called the "Hex". She
                  materializes a new version of Vision that lacks any prior
                  memories and starts living with him in the Hex as a
                  newly-married couple trying to live their ideal suburban life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While attempting to befriend her neighbors (painfully forced
                  to role-play as sitcom stereotypes, and kept from their
                  children) and concealing her and Vision's powers, Wanda
                  becomes visibly pregnant. As it progresses at an accelerated
                  rate, she encounters Monica Rambeau, who had been absorbed
                  into the Hex and took on the alias of "Geraldine", and
                  receives her help in giving birth to twin boys Tommy and
                  Billy. However, Rambeau mentions Pietro and his death at
                  Ultron's hands, inciting Wanda to telekinetically cast her out
                  of Westview. When Vision returns moments later, he briefly
                  appears as a corpse before Wanda resets him.

              <h4>Hunted by S.W.O.R.D.</h4>
              <p>
                As Wanda's children age rapidly, S.W.O.R.D. sends an armed drone
                into Westview in an attempt to kill Wanda. Enraged, she exits
                the Hex, warns Hayward to leave her alone, and emphasizes her
                point by hypnotizing his agents into turning their guns on him.
                Rambeau, who empathizes with Wanda, tries to offer help, but is
                rebuffed. Back in Westview, Wanda gets into a heated argument
                with Vision when he finds out the truth after briefly freeing
                one of Wanda's victims and reading a S.W.O.R.D. communique at
                work. The argument is interrupted when a man claiming to be
                Pietro appears and Wanda briefly accepts him into her life.
                During the town's Halloween festival, Wanda reveals to "Pietro"
                that she does not remember what happened to her other than
                feeling alone and empty, which seemingly made her create the
                Hex. When Wanda learns that Vision has breached the barrier and
                is dying, she expands the Hex to save his life, in the process
                also absorbing the nearby S.W.O.R.D. outpost and Darcy Lewis.

            <div class="overview-sub-section">
              <h4>Battle of Westview</h4>
              <p>
                Following her expansion of the Hex, Wanda starts losing control
                of the altered reality and begins having a mental breakdown.
                Rambeau returns to Westview to warn Wanda of Hayward's plan to
                revive and weaponize Vision, but an enraged Wanda refuses to
                listen and attempts to cast her out once more. When Rambeau
                resists using her newly acquired powers, Wanda's neighbor
                "Agnes" interrupts and takes Wanda to her house, where she
                reveals her true identity as the sorceress Agatha Harkness and
                forces Wanda to relieve her most traumatic memories to learn how
                she created the Hex by threatening Tommy and Billy's lives.
                Eventually, Harkness releases her, mocking Wanda for not knowing
                the full extent of her own abilities before revealing Wanda is
                the legendary "Scarlet Witch", who wields chaos magic and is
                capable of spontaneously altering reality and weaving together
                numerous high-level spells that run automatically. As Wanda
                battles Harkness, the latter absorbs her magic. They are briefly
                interrupted by Hayward's Vision, but Wanda's version fends him
                off. Continuing their battle, Harkness reveals further that
                Wanda is even more powerful than the Sorcerer Supreme and that
                she is destined to destroy the world as the "Harbinger of Chaos"
                before freeing Westview's citizens from Wanda's influence,
                allowing them to reveal to Wanda that her spell has been causing
                them to experience her repressed grief and nightmares.
                Overwhelmed, Wanda accidentally loses control of her powers once
                more and nearly chokes them all to death. Horrified by what she
                has done, Wanda brings down the Hex so the citizens can escape,
                but restores it after her Vision, Billy, and Tommy begin to
                disappear. As invading S.W.O.R.D. agents attack Westview, Billy
                and Tommy disarm them while Rambeau and Lewis stop Hayward and
                Wanda and Harkness renew their fight. The latter seemingly
                absorbs all of Wanda's magic, but realizes too late that Wanda
                had placed protective runes at the Hex's borders to neutralize
                Harkness's magic. Claiming her new identity as the Scarlet
                Witch, Wanda traps Harkness in her Agnes identity before
                permanently bringing down the Hex and sharing a tearful goodbye
                with her family. Wanda meets with a sympathetic Rambeau to
                apologize and vow to better understand her powers before fleeing
                to live remotely in a mountainside cabin, where she studies the
                Darkhold to learn more about her powers before hearing "her
                sons" cry out for help.

              <h3>Corrupted by the Darkhold</h3>

              <h4>Hunt for America Chavez and redemption</h4>
              <p>
                By late 2024, Wanda had gradually been corrupted by the Darkhold
                learning about the multiverse and that alternate "real" versions
                of her sons exist in other universes. After learning of America
                Chavez and her ability to freely travel the multiverse, Wanda
                secretly sends multi-dimensional creatures after her to kill
                Chavez, take her powers for herself, travel to an alternate
                reality where her sons are alive and kill and replace her own
                counterpart. When Stephen Strange seeks Wanda's help in
                protecting Chavez, she accidentally reveals her knowledge of the
                girl and that she had been the one hunting her, explaining her
                plans to him and demanding Strange hand Chavez over. Strange
                refuses, and Wanda attacks Kamar-Taj, killing the majority of
                its sorcerers, with the Sorcerer Supreme, Wong, identifying the
                Scarlet Witch as a being "prophecised to either rule or destroy
                the multiverse".
              </p>
              <p>
                During the attack, Chavez accidentally sends herself and Strange
                to an alternate universe called Earth-838. In pursuit of the
                pair, Wanda attempts to dream-walk; a spell which involves
                temporarily possessing alternate versions of oneself into a
                counterpart's body. When a surviving sorceress, Sara, sacrifices
                herself to destroy the Darkhold and break the dream-walk, Wanda
                forces Wong to lead her to a temple dedicated to the Darkhold's
                author Chthon atop Mount Wundagore, the original source of the
                Darkhold's spells. Using the temple's magic, Wanda
                re-establishes her dream-walk and successfully possesses her
                Earth-838's counterpart's body. She then breaks into the
                Illuminati's headquarters and slaughters most of them without
                hesitation while Strange and Chavez escape with the help of
                scientist Christine Palmer. The trio enter the Gap Junction, a
                space between universes to find the Book of Vishanti, the
                antithesis of the Darkhold, but Wanda appears, destroys the
                book, and takes over Chavez's mind, sending Strange and Palmer
                to an post-incursion universe, and opening a portal back to
                Earth-616.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Mount Wundagore, Wanda begins to absorb Chavez's powers but
                is confronted by a dreamwalking Strange who encourages Chavez to
                believe in herself and use her powers to open a portal to
                Earth-838, through which Tommy and Billy, seeing Wanda choke
                Chavez, recoil in horror, running from her and crying out for
                their real mother to protect them from "the witch". As a result,
                Wanda collapses with grief, and on being assured by her
                838-counterpart that "they will be loved", allows Chavez, Wong,
                and Strange to leave before using her powers to destroy Mount
                Wundagore along with all copies of the Darkhold across the
                multiverse, seemingly killing herself in the process.
